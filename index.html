<h2>Welcome! </h2>

<p>
  This website organizes and presents biomedical resources, developed and maintained by the Ping Lab at UCLA. There are two resources represented here:
</p>


<h4> <a href="https://pinglab-utils.github.io/APIcard/"> The API Card Library (link) </a></h4> 

<p> 
This resource provides a working library of biomedical Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to access information and software tools provided by biomedical knowledge bases.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://pinglab-utils.github.io/KG-Projects">The Knowledge Graph Catalog (link) </a> </h4> 

<p>
This resource catalogs knowledge graphs constructed for a specific use-case, integrating information from multiple biomedical resources.
</p>

<p>
The works presented in these resources were developed as part of the class projects from UCLA Bioinformatics 201 and as hands-on projects from Bridge2AI ENABLE Scholar Program.
