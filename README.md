 Solid Gauge Chart is similar to the <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/demos/angular-gauge/">Angular Gauge Chart</a> and is most commonly used to mimic real-world gauges. The main difference from the Angular Gauge Chart is that the values are displayed by a filled portion of a gauge scale rather than a hand of a mechanical-like gauge.
