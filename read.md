Welcome!

This website organizes and presents biomedical resources, developed and maintained by the Ping Lab at UCLA. There are two resources represented here:

### [The API Card Library](https://pinglab-utils.github.io/APIcard/)

This resource provides a working library of biomedical Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to access information and software tools provided by biomedical knowledge bases.

### [The Knowledge Graph Catalog](https://pinglab-utils.github.io/KG-Projects/)

This resource catalogs knowledge graphs constructed for a specific use-case, integrating information from multiple biomedical resources.

The works presented in these resources were developed as part of the class projects from UCLA Bioinformatics 201 and as hands-on projects from Bridge2AI ENABLE Scholar Program.
